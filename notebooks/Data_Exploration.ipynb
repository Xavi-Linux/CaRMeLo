With this loan I plan to pay off all the credit cards and close them down immediately. I have a good balance between living expenses and debt repayment.<br> Over several years in college I amassed a large debt in credit cards.  Now that I have a stable job and spending under control I will use this loan to consolidate credit card debt and to close them immediately.  I never miss payments and I follow a strict monthly budget of $1,350 in living expenses and a $339 car note.  I have enough in savings to cover 6 months of all expenses, including this loan payment.  Absolutely every other dollar is dedicated to debt repayment.

Thanks.<br>, nan, After amassing credit card debt through several years of college, I now have spending under control and a stable job. With this loan I plan to pay off all the credit cards and close them down immediately. I have a good balance between living expenses and debt repayment.<br> Over several years in college I amassed a large debt in credit cards.  Now that I have a stable job and spending under control I will use this loan to consolidate credit card debt and to close them immediately.  I never miss payments and I follow a strict monthly budget of $1,350 in living expenses and a $339 car note.  I have enough in savings to cover 6 months of all expenses, including this loan payment.  Absolutely every other dollar is dedicated to debt repayment.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.<br> Borrower added on 12/15/11 > Over several years in college I amassed a large debt in credit cards.

Thanks.&lt;br&gt;, nan, After amassing credit card debt through several years of college, I now have spending under control and a stable job. With this loan I plan to pay off all the credit cards and close them down immediately. I have a good balance between living expenses and debt repayment.&lt;br&gt; Over several years in college I amassed a large debt in credit cards.  Now that I have a stable job and spending under control I will use this loan to consolidate credit card debt and to close them immediately.  I never miss payments and I follow a strict monthly budget of $1,350 in living expenses and a $339 car note.  I have enough in savings to cover 6 months of all expenses, including this loan payment.  Absolutely every other dollar is dedicated to debt repayment.
