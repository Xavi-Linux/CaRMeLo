With this loan I plan to pay off all the credit cards and close them down immediately. I have a good balance between living expenses and debt repayment.<br> Over several years in college I amassed a large debt in credit cards.  Now that I have a stable job and spending under control I will use this loan to consolidate credit card debt and to close them immediately.  I never miss payments and I follow a strict monthly budget of $1,350 in living expenses and a $339 car note.  I have enough in savings to cover 6 months of all expenses, including this loan payment.  Absolutely every other dollar is dedicated to debt repayment.
